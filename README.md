A passionate individual who is always thrilled to work on problem solving which develops sustainable systems to create impact. I have a strong affinity for working on and developing Cross Platform, Computer Vision solutions for the ecommerce domain and finance domain such as banking systems. More recently, I've developed a strong interest in developing front-end and back-end digital solutions.

Outside of the techno world, I love that nature takes me travelling places to explore the unexplored, have new experiences, get new inspirations, and be toes for the surprises life has in store for me.
I am a big foodie with a very diverse taste buds. My explorations for lip smacking food are endless. I love to try out every cuisine when I get the chance. Food is another motivation to explore places and keep learning about the culinary practices of any region.

Professionally, I worked as a Software Engineer for over 12 years. I have been lucky to have got the chance to work on both sides of the front-end and back-end application development. I've built multiple applications for multiple platforms known as full stack development. I started with C++, migrating to Java, and continue with bits & pieces with C when needed. Having spent the majority of my professional journey with Java, I specialize in architecting and delivering robust, scalable software solutions. My expertise spans the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis and system design to implementation and deployment. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create efficient, maintainable, and user-centric applications. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and excel at translating complex business requirements into elegant, high-performance code.

Beyond my professional coding explorations, I never miss a chance to get involved with code to remain updated with the latest technologies, and skills that interest me. I actively engage with the tech community through mentorship, knowledge sharing, and participation in industry events. I am passionate about fostering the next generation of software engineers and regularly volunteer to mentor aspiring developers through coding workshops and hackathons. I am planning to create new programming which will be the most productive for business and provide multi-paradigm and parallelism which involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes to improve computational efficiency and performance. It will allow software to take advantage of multi-core processors, distributed systems, and specialized hardware to execute tasks in parallel, thereby accelerating the overall processing speed.
